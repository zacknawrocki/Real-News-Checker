# Real-News-Checker
After seeing the initiative from so many technology companies to combat articles containing fake news, I noticed that there was a major trust concern from the general public, due to relying on one company to decide the legitimacy of a news article. As a result, I was inspired to create a website that will show similar news articles to a given article URL from as many sources as possible. While this unfortunately will not solve the problem of verifying fake news, my hope is that by being informed from all possible sources, I can help the typical news reader become better educated about the article of interest.
